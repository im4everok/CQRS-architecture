# Learning MediatR and CQRS Implementation in C# ASP.NET

Welcome to the "Learning MediatR and CQRS Implementation in C# ASP.NET" project! This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for mastering MediatR and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns in the context of C# ASP.NET development.

## Overview

MediatR is a simple, unambitious mediator implementation in .NET. It is a lightweight library that provides a simple and elegant way to implement the mediator pattern in C# applications. By leveraging MediatR, developers can decouple the communication between components, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

CQRS is a pattern that separates reads (queries) and writes (commands) into separate objects, enabling developers to optimize each side independently. This pattern promotes a clear separation of concerns and helps simplify the design of complex systems.

In this project, i learned how to:

- Set up and configure MediatR in an ASP.NET application.
- Implement commands and command handlers to handle write operations.
- Implement queries and query handlers to handle read operations.
- Explore the benefits of using pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns such as caching.

## Features

- **MediatR Integration**: Learn how to integrate MediatR into your ASP.NET project and leverage its capabilities for implementing the mediator pattern.
- **Command Handling**: Implement commands to perform write operations and use command handlers to encapsulate the logic for handling those commands.
- **Query Handling**: Implement queries to retrieve data and use query handlers to encapsulate the logic for processing those queries.
- **Pipeline Behaviors**: Explore the use of pipeline behaviors in MediatR to implement cross-cutting concerns such as caching, logging, validation, and more.

## Getting Started
